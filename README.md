### Description
The goal when making this app was to practice some developing skill and put all together to complete this project.

### How to use?
Simply change any ingredient using grams and the other ingredients will be calculated automatically. Very simple.

#### Current state
* Currently the app only calculates the amount of the ingredients in **grams**.
* When using a small ingredient amount, the number of pancakes may not be precise.
* The about and contact buttons are not developed yet.

#### Planned
* Add a metric/imperial switch option
* Add conversion to spoons, cups, etc.
* Add translation to other languages

#### Technologies used
* HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Jquery
